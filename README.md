# Job Search Website in React JS

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Description

I have a mode a Job Listings website using React JS.

I used an API for fetching the job data. The API used is [Remotive API](https://remotive.io/api-documentation)

The application has following features:

1. Lists all the remote jobs from the API and displays the results in nicely designed cards.
2. Each job listing can be further explored by navigating to the job details page. Used react-router-dom for dynamic routing.
3. The jobs are displayed with the pagination feature. 15 jobs are displayed at once.
4. The jobs can be filtered on the basis of 'Job Title' or 'Job Type'
5. The UI is designed using Bootstrap and is mobile-friendly.
6. The application is deployed on GitHub Pages, [here](https://psonh.github.io/jobs-search/)
